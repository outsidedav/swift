# {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}
{: #cloudant}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} is a document-oriented DataBase as a Service (DBaaS). It stores data as documents in JSON format. It is built with scalability, high availability, and durability in mind, and is very easy to configure for use in Swift applications. It comes with a wide variety of indexing options that include MapReduce, {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query, full-text indexing, and geospatial indexing. The replication capabilities make it easy to keep data in sync between database clusters, desktop PCs, and mobile devices.

For all of the ways that you can use {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Basics](/docs/services/Cloudant/basics/index.html#cloudant-nosql-db-basics).

## Getting started with the service
{: #getting-started-cloudant}

Ready to get started with {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}? Awesome! You can use the following steps as a guide to get up and running with the service quickly.

### Before you begin

First, be sure you have the following prerequisites ready to go:
<ul><ul>
  <li>CocoaPods (version 1.1.0 or higher)</li>
  <li>iOS (version 9 or higher)</li>
  <li>MacOS (version 10.11.5 or higher)</li>
  <li>Xcode (version 9.0.1 or higher)</li>
</ul></ul>

**Note:** The [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} SDK for Swift![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/cloudant/swift-cloudant) is built using Swift 3.2.  If you are planning to use {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} with Kitura, consider using [Kitura-CouchDB Library ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-CouchDB), which is built using Swift 4.0.

### Creating an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}

See [Creating a Cloudant NoSQL DB instance on IBM Cloud tutorial ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/tutorials/create_service.html#creating-a-cloudant-nosql-db-instance-on-ibm-cloud){:new_window} to provision an instance of the service.


### Installing the iOS Swift SDK

Use the Swift Cloudant SDK to help make coding your app easier. The SDK must be installed in your app code.

1. Open your existing Xcode project directory to the `Podfile`.
2. Under your projects target, add a dependency for the `SwiftCloudant` pod. Be sure the `use_frameworks!` command is also under your target as shown in the following example.
    ```
    target '<yourTarget>' do
      use_frameworks!
        pod 'SwiftCloudant', :git => 'https://github.com/cloudant/swift-cloudant.git'
    end
    ```
    {: screen}
3. Download the `SwiftCloudant` dependency.
    ```
    pod install
    ```
    {: pre}

### Installing the server-side Swift SDK

To use with the Swift Package Manager for server-side development, add the following line to your dependencies in your `Package.swift`:
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/cloudant/swift-cloudant.git")
```
{: pre}

### Initializing the SDK

After you initialize the SDK in your app, you can begin leveraging {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} to store data.


1.  Add the following import to your `AppDelegate.swift` or server-side swift file.
    ```
    import SwiftCloudant
    ```
    {:pre}
2. Initialize the connection to the database.
    ```swift
    let cloudantURL = NSURL(string: "https://username.cloudant.com")!
    let client = CouchDBClient(url: cloudantURL, username: "username", password: "password")
    let dbName = "database"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

## Basic Operations
These basic operations illustrate the fundamental actions to create, read, and destroy your documents, using the client initialized above.

###Create a document
```swift
let create = PutDocumentOperation(id: "doc1", body: ["hello": "world"], databaseName: dbName) {(response, httpInfo, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Encountered an error while creating a document. Error: \(error)")
    } else {
        print("Created document \(response?["id"]) with revision id \(response?["rev"])")
    }
}
client.add(operation: create)
```
{: codeblock}

###Read a document
```swift
let read = GetDocumentOperation(id: "doc1", databaseName: dbName) { (response, httpInfo, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Encountered an error while reading a document. Error: \(error)")
    } else {
        print("Read document: \(response)")
    }   
}
client.add(operation: read)
```
{: codeblock}

###Delete a document
```swift
let delete = DeleteDocumentOperation(id: "doc1",
    revision: "1-revisionidhere",
    databaseName: dbName) { (response, httpInfo, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Encountered an error while deleting a document. Error: \(error)")
    } else {
        print("Document deleted")
    }   
}
client.add(operation: delete)
```
    {: codeblock}


## Testing your app
{: #cloudant_testing}

Think you've got everything set up correctly? Let's test it out!

1. Run your application, making sure to invoke the initialization and respective operations, such as creating a document.
2. Return to the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service instance previously created in your web browser, and launch the service dashboard.
3. Select the database being used, and you should see you freshly created documents in the dashboard.

## Quick start with starter kits
{: #cloudant_starterkits}

Starter kits are one of the fastest ways to leverage the capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can add
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} to any client iOS app or server-side backend by using the starter kits.  The **Infinite Scrolling with Cloudant NoSQL for iOS** starter kit illustrates how to extend a ViewController to display data using pagination. This pattern of app is common for iOS developers, and is a great example for illustrating the capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

To add {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} to a starter kit:

1. Select the [Starter Kit](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appledevelopment/starter-kits) with which you'd like to work.
2. Create the project with the default services.
3. Select **Add Resources > Data > {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}**.
4. Download the project by clicking **Download Code**. For iOS projects, the credentials will be injected into the `BMSCredentials.plist` file in the corresponding key fields. For server-side Swift projects, these credentials can be found in the `config/local-dev.json` file.


## Next steps
{: #cloudant_next}

Great job! You've added a level of secure persistence to your app. Keep the momentum going by trying one of the following options:

* View the  [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} SDK for Swift![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/cloudant/swift-cloudant) source code.
