# Adding a chatbot
{: #assistant}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service to build applications that understand natural-language input and respond to users with human-like conversation.

The following list outlines the flow of how the integration works:

1. Users interact with the interface that is implemented in your app.
2. Your app sends user input to the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK.
3. The {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Swift SDK connects to a workspace, which is a container for your dialog flow and training data.
4. The workspace interprets the user input and directs the flow of the conversation, sending a response to your app.
5. Your app displays the response for the user.

## Before you begin
{: #prereqs-chatbot}

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* An instance of the [{{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service](/docs/services/conversation/getting-started.html)
* iOS 10.0+
* Xcode 9.3+
* Swift 4.1+
* CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager

You can install the [Watson Swift SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk) by using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk#cocoapods), [Carthage](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk#carthage), or the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk#swift-package-manager). By using CocoaPods(https://cocoapods.org/) to manage dependencies, you get only the frameworks that you need, as opposed to the entire Watson Swift SDK. If you are new to CocoaPods, you can install it easily:

```console
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
{: codeblock}

## Step 1. Creating an instance of Watson Assistant
{: #instance-watson-chatbot}

Provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, select **{{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}**. The service configuration screen opens.
2. Give your service instance a name, or use the preset name.
3. Select an app from the **Connect** menu if you'd like to bind your instance to an app.
4. Select a pricing plan, and click **Create**.
5. Select the **Credentials** tab to view your service credentials. These values are used to connect to the service from your app.
6. Click **Launch tool** to build your chatbot assistant. Follow the instructions on the landing page to build your own chatbot, or go to the **Skills** tab and select **Create new**. On the **Add Dialog Skill** page, choose the **Use sample skill** tab and select the **Customer Care Sample Skill** to get started quickly. You can continue to refine this skill or create others to be used by your app later.
7. Click the menu on your new skill, and select **View API Details**. You can now see the `Workspace ID` that you need in addition to the service credentials.

## Step 2. Downloading and building dependencies
{: #download-depend-chatbot}

The following example uses AssistantV1. For more information about the AssistantV2 framework, see the [Watson SDK AssistantV2 documentation](https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/swift-sdk/services/AssistantV2/index.html).

Using your favorite text editor, create a new `Podfile` in the root directory of your project (where your `.xcodeproj` file is located) by running `pod init`. Then, add a line to specify the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} framework of the Watson Swift SDK as a dependency:

```pod
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'IBMWatsonAssistantV1'
```
{: codeblock}

For a production app, you might also want to specify a particular [version requirement](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html#specifying-pod-versions) to avoid unexpected changes from new releases of the Watson Swift SDK.

With your `Podfile` in place, now you can download the dependencies. Use a terminal to navigate to the root directory of your project, then run CocoaPods:

```console
pod install
```
{: codeblock}

Cocoapods downloads the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} framework, and builds it in the `Pods/` folder of your project.

To prevent Pod build failures, open the file that ends in `.xcworkspace` instead of the `.xcodeproj` when you open the project in Xcode.

## Step 3. Adding a virtual assistant to your app
{: #virtual-assist-chatbot}

The following samples help you add {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} capabilities to your application, typically in the `ViewController.swift`. Using the following examples, you can extend the Assistant calls for your use case.

1. Add an import statement for {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, for example `import Assistant`.
  ```swift
  import Assistant
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Instantiate the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service:
  ```swift
  let assistant = Assistant(version: "yyyy-mm-dd", apikey: "your-api-key-here")

  // save context to state to continue the conversation later
  var context: Context?
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  **Tip**: This example saves the context to state. For a better understanding of this object and how to adapt it for your use case, see the [context variable documentation](/docs/services/assistant/dialog-runtime.html#context-variables). Check out the [version parameter documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant#versioning) or use the date that the {site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service was created.

3. Initialize the conversation. Depending on how your assistant is configured, it can provide an initial response to the user:
  ```swift
  // Start a conversation
  assistant.message(workspaceID: "your-workspace-ID-here) { response, error in
      if let error = error {
         print(error)
      }

      guard let message = response?.result else {
          print("Failed to get the message.")
          return
      }

      print("Conversation ID: \(message.context.conversationID!)")
      print("Response: \(message.output.text.joined())")

      // Set the context to state
      self.context = message.context    
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

4. Send a message and the context to the assistant:
  ```swift
  print("Request: When are you open?")
  let input = InputData(text: "When are you open?")

  assistant.message(workspaceID: workspace, input: input, context: self.context) { response, error in
      if let error = error {
         print(error)
      }

      guard let message = response?.result else {
          print("Failed to get the message.")
          return
      }

      print("Conversation ID: \(message.context.conversationID!)")
      print("Response: \(message.output.text.joined())")

      // Update the context
      self.context = message.context
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

When you run your app with these examples with the default assistant, the following messages are displayed in the console:
```
Conversation ID: cbb18524-1e78-4bb5-a6ea-ceb9311da391
Response: Hello, I’m a demo customer care virtual assistant to show you the basics.  I can help with directions to my store, hours of operation and booking an in-store appointment.
Request: When are you open?
Response: Our hours are Monday to Friday 10am to 8pm and Friday and Saturday 11am to 6pm.
```
{: screen}

5. Explore the Watson SDK [Assistant documentation](https://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/swift-sdk/services/AssistantV1/index.html) to build out your application's functionality.

## Using starter kits
{: #starterkits-chatbot}

With starter kits, you can quickly and easily use the capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can add {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} to any server-side back end by using the starter kits. The Chatbot for iOS with Watson Starter Kit illustrates how to use the deep learning capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} by adding a natural language interface to your application that automates interactions with your users.

1. Select the [starter kit](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appledevelopment/starter-kits){:new_window} with which you want to work.
2. Create the project with the default services.
3. Click **Add Resources > Watson > {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}**.
4. Download the project by clicking **Download Code**. You can find the service credentials in the `config/local-dev.json` file.
